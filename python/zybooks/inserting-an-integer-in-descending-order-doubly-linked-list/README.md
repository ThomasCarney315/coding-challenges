Inserting an integer in descending order (doubly-linked list)


Given main.py and an IntNode class, complete the IntList class (a linked list of IntNodes) by writing the insert_in_descending_order() method to insert new IntNodes into the IntList in descending order.

Ex. If the input is:

3 4 2 5 1 6 7 9 8
the output is:

9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
